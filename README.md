# Spacetime-AR-EduEx
A repo to save the unity project that was part of the presentation at IISD's annual EduEx 2019.

This app allows you to spawn planets in the real world using AR cards and lets you visualize the spacetime fabric according to Einstein's theory of relativity in real time.

The planets and the spaceship attract each other with their gravity and can revolve around each depending on how they are placed.

Pressing the eye icon causes the game to go to the spacetime visualization mode, where the space time fabric deforms according to the weight and location of the objects in real time

The reset button can be used to reset all the objects back to their original position
